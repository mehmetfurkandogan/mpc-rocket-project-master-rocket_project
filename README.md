# MPC Design for a Rocket

In this project, we focused on creating an MPC system for a rocket prototype. This involved
designing an MPC regulator, incorporating tracking mechanisms, and implementing an estimator to
address potential offsets caused by disturbances. Our testing encompassed a non-linear simulation,
highlighting the challenges of employing linear MPC in a non-linear system. We concluded the
project with the design and implementation of a non-linear MPC using CASADI, followed by a
comparative analysis of its performance against the linear MPC.
